# Survival-XML-TME-BC

This repository contains the code and data supporting the manuscript *Integrated Multiomics Analysis of Immune Suppression in Breast Tumors and Clinical Outcomes*. This study explores the impact of immune-suppressive macrophages on breast tumors, integrating multiomics data such as RNA-seq deconvolution, cell-cell communication assays, imaging mass cytometry (IMC), and survival analysis. Follow the steps below to recreate the studyâ€™s results.

## Overview of Analysis Steps

### 1. Estimating Cell Fractions
To estimate cell fractions for bulk RNA-seq profiles, use Signature Matrices available in our previous work (https://github.com/YounessAzimzade/XML-TME-NAC-BC). We recommend using **CIBERSORTx** for cell fraction estimation. Once fractions are estimated and clinical outcome data are retrieved, you should have datasets similar to `NAC.csv` for the NAC cohort and `MBRC.csv`/`TCGA.csv` for other cohorts.

### 2. Analyzing the Role of Cell Types in Clinical Outcomes
Explore the influence of cell type frequencies on clinical outcomes using **Support Vector Machines (SSVM)** and **Random Survival Forests (RSF)**:
   - **SSVM.ipynb** and **RSF.ipynb**: Train models on cell fractions, clinical features, and outcomes to predict clinical outcomes.
   - **SHAP analysis**: Feature importance is extracted using SHAP values, yielding SHAP datasets with processed feature columns (done in SSVM.ipynb and RSF.ipynb)  
   - After SHAP analysis, **fig2.R** is used to calculate "Survival Scores."

### 3. Juxtaposing Survival and pCR Scores
Once "Survival Scores" are calculated, these scores are compared with pathological complete response (pCR) scores (from https://github.com/YounessAzimzade/XML-TME-NAC-BC) in **fig3.R**.

### 4. Classical Survival Analysis
For additional insights, run traditional survival analyses using scripts in the **Survival Analysis** folder.

### 5. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) and scRNA-seq Analysis
IMC and single-cell RNA-seq data are analyzed with scripts available in their respective folders. Follow folder-specific instructions to reproduce analyses and visualizations for spatial organization and immune profiling insights.
