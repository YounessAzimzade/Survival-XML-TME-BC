# Survival-XML-TME-BC

This repository contains the code and data supporting the manuscript *Integrated multiomics analysis unveils how macrophages drive immune suppression in breast tumors and affect clinical outcomes*. This study investigates the role of immune-suppressive macrophages in breast tumors, integrating multiomics data such as bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data. Follow the steps below to recreate the studyâ€™s results.

## Overview of Analysis Steps

### 1. Estimating Cell Fractions
To estimate cell fractions for bulk RNA-seq profiles, use the Signature Matrices available in our previous work: https://github.com/YounessAzimzade/XML-TME-NAC-BC. We recommend using **CIBERSORTx** for cell fraction estimation. After estimating fractions and retrieving clinical outcome data, you should have datasets similar to `NAC.csv` for the NAC cohort and `MBRC.csv`/`TCGA.csv` for other cohorts.

### 2. Analyzing the Role of Cell Types in Clinical Outcomes
Explore the influence of cell type frequencies on clinical outcomes using **Survival Support Vector Machines (SSVM)** and **Random Survival Forests (RSF)**:
   - **SSVM.ipynb** and **RSF.ipynb**: Train models on cell fractions, clinical features, and outcomes to predict clinical outcomes.
   - **SHAP analysis**: Extract feature importance using SHAP values, yielding SHAP datasets with processed feature columns (performed in SSVM.ipynb and RSF.ipynb).  
   - After SHAP analysis, calculate "Survival Scores" using **fig2.R**.

### 3. Juxtaposing Survival and pCR Scores
Once "Survival Scores" are calculated, these scores are compared with pathological complete response (pCR) scores (available at https://github.com/YounessAzimzade/XML-TME-NAC-BC) using **fig3.R**.

### 4. Classical Survival Analysis
For additional insights, perform traditional survival analyses using scripts in the **Survival Analysis** folder.

### 5. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) and scRNA-seq Analysis
Analyze IMC and single-cell RNA-seq data using scripts in their respective folders. Follow folder-specific instructions to reproduce analyses and generate visualizations for spatial organization and immune profiling insights.
